EyeSpeak is an app for the parlytic, people paralyzed form the shoudlers down, allowing one to use their eyes and voice to control a computer. With EyeSpeak one can write up a document, go on the internet, shope online, and even play video games hands free.

EyeSpeak is an app that provides accessible and easy computer access to the paralytic, allowing them to perform simple computer actions in their daily lives. It is designed to allow for people to be able to type a letter, send an email, browse the internet, play video games, and enjoy the ability to use a computer when they were not able to before.

The mouse is operated by measuring eye movements and converting them to mouse inputs; for example â€” left winks convert to left clicks. The keyboard detects speech from the user and converts them to a full sentence using a library that utilizes artificial intelligence. Afterwards, each character is converted to a keyboard input to finally output a complete sentence or phrase; in addition, backspace, return/enter, and special characters are also possible.
